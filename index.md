# Welcome to the Computational Materials Science Laboratory
The &quot;Computational Materials Science Laboratory&quot; is a part of the &quot;Center of
Semiconductor Devices and Nanotechnology&quot; at Institute of Physics of Yerevan State
University.
Our goals are:

- Design and predict new materials for various applicationsâ€¤
- Develop novel computational methods for accelerating materials discovery and characterization.

The computational methods combine ab-inito methods, solid
state physics, chemistry, evolutionary structure search algorithms and AI.
Our focus areas encompass solid-state battery materials, including those based on Li-ion, 
post Li-ion, and organic batteries. Additionally, we are actively involved in the
exploration of novel 2D materials for catalytic applications and the design of super-hard
materials.
For those passionate about these research areas and computational work, whether
you&#39;re a student, PhD candidate, or PostDoc, our lab presents exciting opportunities.
Join us on a journey to delve into the dynamic and fascinating realm of materials
science!
