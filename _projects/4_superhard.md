Superhard materials play a pivotal role in numerous applications, defined by a
Vickers hardness surpassing 40 GPa. Among the well-known superhard
materials are various carbon allotropes, with diamond ranking as the hardest
material. This is closely followed by carbon nitrides, cubic boron nitride, and
diverse boron allotropes. Transition metal compounds such as chromium,
rhenium, molybdenum, and tungsten in the form of borides, nitrides, and carbides
also exhibit exceptional hardness, with tungsten carbide (WC) and titanium
nitride (TiN) being widely used in machining tools and mining equipment.
Our research endeavors to discover novel binary, ternary, and quaternary
superhard materials within the categories of carbides, borides, and nitrides. By
expanding our understanding of these materials, we aim to contribute to the
development of new superhard compounds with potential applications across
various industries.
