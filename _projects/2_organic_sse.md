Humanity is facing significant global challenges, such as climate change,
pollution, habitat loss, and declining biodiversity, with negative effects on our
lives, economy, and society. The growing energy demand is being addressed
through a strategic shift toward climate-friendly technologies, especially in
developing sustainable and clean battery manufacturing processes. Exploring
organic electrode materials is a promising avenue in this initiative. These
materials are considered sustainable because they consist of abundant and
lightweight elements, making them more cost-effective than traditional inorganic
materials. Inorganic materials, like cobalt, are energy-intensive to process and
are often classified as critical raw materials. On the other hand, organics can be
thermally recycled, using biomass-derived precursors. Combining organic
electrode materials with solid-state electrolytes not only solves the problem of
organics dissolving but also allows for a wider range of solid electrolyte materials,
extending beyond the limitations of high-voltage cathode materials. The project
has two main goals: 1) computationally designing and identifying promising
organic materials for post Li-ion batteries, and 2) updating the existing database
for organic materials used in batteries.
