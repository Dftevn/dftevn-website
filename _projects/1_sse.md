All solid state batteries (ASSB), with solid state electrolytes (SSE), open a
floodgate of prospective characteristic properties for future energy storage
systems. Although, known solid state electrolytes (sulfide, oxides, borates, and
so on) do not satisfy all performance requirements, such as high ion conductivity
or compatibility with anode materials, for wide implementation in various
applications. Now, the major effort is to find novel solid state electrolytes. In
contrast to experimental methods, computational methods can drastically
accelerate novel material search. The goal of the project is to perform
computational search for novel solid state electrolytes using data mined structure
prediction, machine learning and evolutionary structure prediction algorithms.
