Meeting the escalating demand for electric energy necessitates advancements in
battery technology with higher energy density. Solid-state batteries, heralded as
a climate-neutral solution, exhibit promisingly high energy densities. However, 
persistent challenges lie in discovering solid-state electrolytes characterized by
both high ionic conductivity and stable electrode interfaces.
Beyond this, alternative ion batteries, including Sodium-ion (Na), Potassium-ion
(K), Magnesium-ion (Mg), or dual-ion configurations, play a pivotal role in
sustainable development. Unearthing novel electrode or electrolyte materials for
these alternative ion batteries is essential. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have
emerged as a compelling alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), particularly for
large-scale energy storage. Leveraging sodium&#39;s abundance, eco-friendliness,
and cost-effectiveness, SIBs hold promise. Noteworthy progress has been
achieved in developing room-temperature SIBs employing organic liquid
electrolytes. However, safety concerns persist, mirroring challenges faced by
their lithium counterparts due to the volatile and flammable nature of liquid
electrolytes.

A common challenge faced by &quot;beyond Li-ion&quot; batteries involves the necessity to
develop or discover new materials tailored to current battery technology.
Addressing this challenge, our goal is to predict novel materials for post Li-ion
batteries using structure prediction methods such as USPEX (universal structure
predictor: evolutionary crystallography), CE (cluster expansion), and DMSP
(data-mined structure predictor). However, predicting the crystal structure of
solid-state electrolytes or cathode materials, comprised of diverse atom types,
poses computational challenges. To overcome this hurdle, we are exploring the
integration of machine learning and orbital-free DFT (OF-DFT) methods in
conjunction with USPEX or CE.
